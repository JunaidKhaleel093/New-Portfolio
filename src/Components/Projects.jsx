                A 3D Slider is a visually captivating carousel or slideshow that
                brings an added depth to content, creating a more immersive user
                experience. Unlike standard sliders, this 3D slider mimics
                real-world perspectives, with each slide presenting in layers
                that can rotate, tilt, zoom, or even animate as users interact
                with it. Elements may appear to float, fade in and out, or move
                along an axis.
